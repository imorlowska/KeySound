As technology develops it becomes more and more available to people all around the globe. This research will propose a way to include more blind and visually impaired users in having easy access to using personal computers easily.

The proposed solution is a special software using spatial to audio keyboard mapping (layout to surrounding sounds) through binaural recording and a specialised set of Braille keycap adhesives. It can not only greatly improve the ease of acquiring easy text input but also greatly reduce the costs and the time of adaptation/learning.
